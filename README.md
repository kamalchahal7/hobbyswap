# HobbySwap

Have you managed to use all of the equipment you've bought in your life more than a handful of times?

Right now, people get caught up in a lot of impulse purchases and, sometimes, impulse hobby changes -- which tends to lead to a lot of waste, both in the environment and in our wallets. Trouble is, there aren't many great ways to dispose of these things things.

Sites like eBay and Kijiji are focused on money. Facebook Marketplace can't tag. And how are you supposed to find someone willing to buy your old stuff without getting scammed?

Well -- what if you take the money out of the equation? 

HobbySwap is the place to trade your gently used or like new hobby and sports equipment for stuff you actually want! 

Search for what you need, message the owners, and arrange a trade -- it's that simple.
